USER: I have some questions about my master thesis
SYSTEM: Sure! What do you want me to tell you about master theses?
USER: I missed enrolling for it
SYSTEM: That's not an issue. Generally, your master thesis registration is independent of the examination registration period and can be done at any time at the examination office. But to be really sure, I suggest to check your exam regulation for more details as this can vary from course to course.
USER: How do I register it
SYSTEM: Oh, registering for your master thesis is super easy. You need to fill out the form on the exam registration website under the tab 'My Application Forms' and hand it to the examination office. That's it.
USER: I'd like to change my thesis topic, can I?
SYSTEM: Sure, you can change your master thesis topic, but only once and only within the first 3 months of processing. I suggest you discuss further procedures with your thesis supervisor and your responsible administrator at the examination office since this is decided on an individual basis.
USER: Ok thanks. bye
SYSTEM: See you, have a nice day! (Please rate this conversation now)
