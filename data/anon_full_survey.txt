I was concentrating on the answers that it gave me instead of the pronouns it was using to describe itself.|I had no problem with the use of "you" because it was pertaining to me. It made it feel like the chat was more personal and not aimed at just a general student.|When I know I am dealing with a robot or AI I never really assign it a gender, because it is a machine. I don't give my lawn mower or my PC a gender, so I don't give a chatbot one either. If I don't know that the entity I am chatting with is a program, then that is a different story.|It answered the questions thoroughly and with  enough detail that I felt it understood what I was asking it.|The chatbot seemed to be a little stern and almost cold. It was very matter-of-fact, which I guess is okay, but a little warmer demeanor may have made it seem a little more lifelike. It needed the prompts to be almost exactly the way they were suggested before answering the queries. I learned to nearly copy the questions word-for-word and with exact capitalization to get the proper response which is somewhat frustrating.
